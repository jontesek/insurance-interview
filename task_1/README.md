# Task 1

## Usage
To run program, simply do `python main.py`.
You can edit input data in the script directly (line 34).

## Tests
You can run tests by `pytest tests.py`. 

You need to install `pytest` library first: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Description
The file `main.py` contains the solution. There are two different solutions, both working correctly according to tests. First, I tried to design my own solution, but got confused with using nested cycles. Then I remembered it's usually possible to find a solution to your problem using Google. I hesitated for a bit, but then I swallowed my pride and very quickly found [this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-such-that-no-two-elements-are-adjacent/). I read it, learnt something new and applied it for my case.
